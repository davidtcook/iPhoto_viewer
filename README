This is a hack ! (of course)

There are two programs here, probably should be merged in some clever way :

allphotos.rb - reads from the iPhoto filesystem, and servers up pages of thumbnails to view

allphotos2.rb - reads from the iPhoto SQLite database, and serves up pages of thumbnails of Flagged items to view

TODO - merge the programs, allow any album to be chosen, add Gemfile etc etc
